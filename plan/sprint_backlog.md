# Sprint Backlog
## What is a Sprint Backlog ?
A sprint backlog consists of tasks that are identified by a team that are to be complected within a given sprint. The Sprint backlog items are composed of items that have been taken from the product backlog during the sprint planning stage. These sprint backlog items are broken down into sprints in relation to their story points (ie: how long the task is estimated to take) and their importance/necessity. In a sprint backlog it is also important to note that these user stories can be further refined at this stage as long as they do not compromise the sprint goal or the termination of the sprint.
